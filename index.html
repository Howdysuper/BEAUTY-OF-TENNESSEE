            <p style="font-size: 200%;">3.) Lover's Leap</p>
            <img src="https://cdn.thecrazytourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ccimage-shutterstock_679022335.jpg" alt="Great view">
            <p> This is place is the best place to visit if you want to relax at the sights of a admiring beauty of Tennessee or if you are an exploring type of person. Tennessee is home to some beautiful natural sights, but perhaps the best of the lot can be found at Lover's Leap, which is where you can spot seven different states you can see Seven States. The rare white Fallow deer can also be seen within the Rock City attraction, but for the best views of the land surrounding Lookout Mountain visitors will have to be brave enough to cross the Swing-A-Long bridge which is real scary. From Lover's Leap you will, on a clear day you will be able to see Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. If you squint, you might just make out Kentucky and Virginia too also a great test for the eyes. Overall, this place is great for people who love to do some adventuring.
